The attached JPG file shows the layout and overall implementation. 

The attached MP4 file shows the CPU executing a simple program: 
  - A value of "0x01" was first stored in memory location "0xF" prior to starting the program 
  - The program is only 8 instructions long:
          LDA 0xF
          ADD 0xF
          ADD 0xF
          SUB 0xF
          ADD 0xF
          ADD 0xF
          SUB 0xF
          OUT
    - Each instruction cycle has 6 T-states of which the first 3 ("Fetch" cycle, T1 through T3) always perform the same sequence:
          - During T1: load the Program Counter (Ep) via the W-bus into the Memory Addr Register (Lm)
          - During T2: increment the Program Counter (Cp) 
          - During T3: put RAM content (CE) onto the W-bus and load instruction in the InstrReg (Li) and decode the Control signals
    - The next 3 T-states ("Execute" cycle) depend on the instruction to be executed and are governed by the Controls signals:
      - During a "LDA" instruction:
          - During T4: put lowest nibble (=mem addr) onto the bus (Ei) and load it into the MemAddrReg (Lm), thereby retrieving the mem content 
          - During T5: put the mem content onto the bus (CE) and into the A-register (La)
          - During T6: nothing is done here
      - During a "ADD" instruction:
          - During T4: put lowest nibble (=mem addr loc) onto the bus (Ei) and load it into the MemAddrReg (Lm), thereby retrieving the mem content 
          - During T5: put the mem content onto the bus (CE) and into the B-register (Lb). The adder is set to "add" mode. 
          - During T6: put the adder output (=sum) onto the bus (Eu) and load it into the A-register (La) 
      - During a "SUB" instruction:
          - During T4: put lowest nibble (=mem addr) onto the bus (Ei) and load it into the MemAddrReg (Lm), thereby retrieving the mem content 
          - During T5: put the mem content onto the bus (CE) and into the A-register (La), set adder in "subtract" mode (Su) 
          - During T6: put the adder output (=difference) onto the bus (Eu) and load it into the A-regiser (La) 
      - During a "OUT" instruction:
          - During T4: put the A-register onto the bus (Ea) and load it into the OUT register (Lo)  
          - During T5: nothing is done here 
          - During T6: nothing is done here
